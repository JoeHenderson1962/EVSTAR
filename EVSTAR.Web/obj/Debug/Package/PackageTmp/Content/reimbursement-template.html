<p>It looks like you’ve chosen to take your device to a local repair provider.  Here are the next steps for completing your repair and having your payment reimbursed.</p>

<p>First, find a local repair provider that’s convenient for you.  You can use our zip code search if you need a little help finding one.  <a href="http://www.gotechcycle.com/PhoneRepairProviders.aspx">Phone Repair Providers</a></p>

<p>Your local repair provider will fix your device and you’ll pay them directly for that repair. We want to make sure your reimbursement goes as quickly as possible so make sure the following information is on your receipt.  It’s good to confirm with the repair provider that this information will be on the receipt prior to starting the repair.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Your contact #</li>
<li>Make</li>
<li>Model</li>
<li>IMEI/serial #</li>
</ul>

<p>After your repair is complete and paid for, you’ll need to submit a copy of the receipt to us.   When you’re ready with your receipt, please use this link for scanning instructions.  <a href="https://www.gotechcycle.com/SubmitReceipt.aspx">Submit your receipt.</a></p>
