<p>It looks like you’ve chosen to send your device to us for repair. Here are the next steps for completing your repair.</p>

<p>You’re going to use a prepaid shipping label; click <a href="https://www.gotechcycle.com/Content/{LABEL}">{LABEL}</a> to print your shipping label.   Once your shipping label is printed you can either pack your device yourself you’re ready to package your device.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions for packing your device.  If you prefer, there are local shipping companies who will package your device for you for a fee.</p>
  
<p>
<ol>
<li>You want to make sure that your device arrives safe and sound so wrap the device in bubble wrap, newspaper, or packing paper to protect it.</li>
<li>Devices can be fragile so find a box that is a little bit larger than the device.  When you are packing your device in that box, you’ll want to add additional packing material so it doesn't move around a lot.</li> 
<li>Close and seal the box with packing tape, making sure that it’s properly sealed.</li>
<li>Secure the shipping label to the box.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>When your package is ready, you’ll head to the nearest Fedex drop off location to ship it.  Here’s a link if you need help finding one <a href="https://www.fedex.com/locate/index.html?locale=en_US#">Fedex Dropoff Locations</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll let you know when we receive your package in an email and keep you informed throughout the repair process.</p>
