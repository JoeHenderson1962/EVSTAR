                <ul>
                    <li>Rarely, your Mac might experience a software or hardware issue that requires it to restart. When it starts up again, you might see a message that your computer was restarted because of a problem.</li>
                    <li>Unexpected restarts are usually caused by software installed on your Mac, or by devices connected to your Mac. If the issue causes your Mac to restart every time it attempts to start up, your Mac might eventually shut down. Use the steps below to check the software and hardware on your Mac.</li>

                    <li>Install all available software updates</li>
                    <li>If your Mac suspects that a particular app caused the restart, it might ask whether you would like to move the app to the Trash. Click Move to Trash, then contact the software developer to see if a software update is available.</li>
                    <li>Use safe mode to try to isolate the cause of the issue.</li>
                    <li>Reinstall macOS. If the issue continues after reinstalling macOS, follow the steps below to check your hardware.</li>

                    <li>Use your Mac for the amount of time that it would usually take for an unexpected restart to occur.</li>
                    <li>If an unexpected restart occurs, continue to the next step to check the internal RAM and third-party hardware.</li>
                    <li>If an unexpected restart doesn't occur, turn off the Mac and connect one peripheral device at a time until an unexpected restart occurs.</li>

Your iPhone uses on-device machine learning to understand your daily charging routine so that it can wait until you need to use your iPhone to finish charging past 80 percent.* Charging in this way reduces the wear on your battery and improves its lifespan.
