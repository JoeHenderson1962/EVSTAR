                    <li>Always make sure your MacBook is using the latest version of macOS. If you’re connected to the Internet, macOS automatically checks for software updates every week, but you still control when the updates are installed. To confirm that you’re using the latest software, go to the Apple menu and choose Software Update.</li>

                    <li>Update Now installs the latest updates for the currently installed version. Learn about macOS Big Sur updates, for example.</li>
                    <li>Upgrade Now installs a major new version with a new name, such as macOS Big Sur. Learn about the latest macOS upgrade, or about old versions of macOS that are still available.</li>
                    <li>NOTE: If Software Update says that your Mac is up to date, then macOS and all of the apps it installs are up to date, including Safari, Messages, Mail, Music, Photos, FaceTime, Calendar, and Books.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Energy. The Energy Saver preference pane includes several settings that determine power levels for your MacBook. Your MacBook knows when it’s plugged in and runs accordingly. When using battery power, it dims the screen and uses other components sparingly. If you change this setting to maximize performance, your battery will drain more quickly.</li>
                    <li>Brightness. Dim the screen to the lowest comfortable level to achieve maximum battery life. For instance, when watching a video on an airplane, you may not need full brightness if the cabin lights are off.</li>
                    <li>Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi consumes power, even if you are not using it to connect to a network. You can turn it off in the Wi-Fi status menu in the menu bar or in Network preferences.</li>
                    <li>Applications and peripherals. Disconnect peripherals and quit applications not in use. Eject an SD card if you’re not currently accessing it.</li>

                                        <li>Turn off “Enable Power Nap while on battery power”. This setting prevents your Mac from checking for mail or other iCloud updates during sleep which improves standby time.</li>
                                        <li>Turn on "Optimize video streaming while on battery”. This setting lets high-dynamic-range (HDR) video play in standard dynamic range (SDR) while on battery power, which uses less energy.</li>
