    <h3>UNEXPECTED SHUTDOWN OR RESTART</h3>
    <div id="b-6-5" class="accordiony">
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <div>
            If your Xbox console is unexpectedly shutting down, it may be because it’s not getting enough ventilation, or there may be a problem with the power supply. Try the following solutions.<br />
        </div>
        <h3><b>Step 1:</b> If the console is too hot</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you see a message that says your Xbox is getting improper ventilation, or if the console is hot to the touch, follow these steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turn off the console.</li>
                        <li>Wait at least one hour.</li>
                        <li>Move the console to a well-ventilated spot.</li>
                        <li>Turn on the console.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It is important to make sure your console is in a cool, well-ventilated place. Remove any objects on, under, or right next to the console. For more info see:</li>
                <li>How to position and ventilate your Xbox console</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><b>Step 2:</b> Troubleshoot your power supply</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>If your console continues to shut down unexpectedly, the problem might be the power supply. For info about how to troubleshoot power supply issues, go to:</li>
                <li>important To ensure that your console is receiving the full voltage necessary, plug your console’s power cord directly into a wall outlet and not any kind of surge protector or extension cord.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><b>Step 3:</b> Change the console settings so it doesn't turn off automatically</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn on the console.</li>
                <li>Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.</li>
                <li>Select Profile & system > Settings > General > Power mode & startup.</li>
                <li>Under Options, select Turn off after, and then select Don’t turn off automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><b>Step 4:</b> Perform a system reset to clear any corruption</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Console shutdowns can sometimes happen due to system corruption, requiring the console be reset to factory defaults. For info on how to reset your console operating system, go to:</li>
                <li>Important System corruption can sometimes spread to external storage devices, so unplug any external storage (such as external hard drives) before performing a system reset and leave such devices unplugged until you’re able to verify whether the issue is still occurring after the reset.</li>

    <div id="c-6-5" class="accordiony">
        <h3>Can't connect to the Internet</h3>
        <div id="a-c-6-5">
            <b>Step 1:</b> If you're connecting to a community (Public) network
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOTE: If you’re connecting to a home (private) network, skip this step and go to either ”Wireless connections” or ”Wired connections” below, depending on whether you’re connecting with a wireless or wired connection.</li>
                    <li>You need to contact the administrator of your community network and request that your console be added to the community network filter. When you ask the community admin to add your console to a filter, you must have your console's IP address and MAC address available. To find the IP address and MAC address for your console, follow these steps:</li>
                    <li>Press the Xbox button to open the guide.</li>
                    <li>Select Profile & system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Network settings.</li>
                    <li>Select Advanced settings. The IP address and MAC address will be listed on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Write down the IP address and MAC address.</li>
                    <li>When you have this information, contact your community admin. If the admin is unable or unwilling to add your console to the network filter, you will not be able to connect to Xbox on that network.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <b>Step 2:</b> Wireless connections (Check for other wireless interference)
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active interference occurs when other devices are broadcasting a wireless signal or are causing some other form of electromagnetic interference. Examples of active interference are microwaves, ovens, air conditioners, CRT televisions, wireless headsets, baby monitors, other wireless networks, cordless phone systems, and wireless speakers.</li>
                    <li>Note As a best practice to minimize potential wireless interference, make sure all the cables on the back of your console are gathered away from and are not touching the console.</li>
                    <li>Passive interference occurs when a wireless signal passes through objects. This causes the wireless signal to be weakened and refracted. Materials that cause passive interference include concrete, glass, lead and copper piping, insulation, mirrors, gun safes, filing cabinets, tile, and plaster.</li>
                    <li>Attenuation occurs as the wireless signal degrades over distance. Routers have a limited broadcast range, which this varies from device to device. A device’s range will also be additionally reduced when the signal passes through solid objects. The ideal distance from the wireless router for the Xbox console is usually between 5 and 50 feet.</li>
                    <li>
                        Line of sight is important when dealing with interference. Try to eliminate as many points of interference as you can along that line. You can do this by turning off or moving any devices along that line that could cause interference. You can also relocate the console or the router to minimize interference.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moving devices outside of entertainment cabinets or desks can often help improve wireless signals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>test your connection again (Profile & system > Settings > General > Network settings > Test network connection). If the connection test is not successful, continue to the next step.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <b>Step 3:</b> Power cycle your console and network hardware
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unplug the power cable from the back of the router, modem, or gateway for 5 minutes. If you have a router and a modem, unplug the power cable from both devices.</li>
                    <li>
                        Restart your console.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Press and hold the Xbox button in the center of your controller to open the Power Center. Select Restart console and then select Restart. After the console shuts down, touch the Xbox button on the console again to restart.)</li>
                            <li>(If the console appears to be frozen, press and hold the Xbox button on the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off.After the console shuts down, touch the Xbox button on the console again to restart</li>
                            <li>After 5 minutes, plug the modem or gateway in first, and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.</li>
                            <li>If you are using a router, plug in the router and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.</li>
                            <li>Test your connection again (Profile & system > Settings > General > Network settings > Test network connection). If the connection test is not successful, continue to the next step.</li>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect your console directly to your modem instead of connecting it to your router. This is a temporary solution meant to help determine the cause of the problem.</li>
                    <li>If you can connect to Xbox with a direct-to-modem connection, your console and modem are working as expected. To connect to Xbox using your router, you might need to change a setting on your router.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <b>Step 5:</b> Connect to XBox using router
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>On your router, unplug the network cable connecting the router to your Xbox console (leave the other end of this cable plugged into your Xbox).</li>
                    <li>On your modem, unplug the network cable that connects the modem to your router. At this point, neither the Xbox nor the modem should be connected to the router.</li>
                    <li>Now connect your Xbox directly to your modem (use the same cable that was connecting your Xbox to your router).</li>
                    <li>Press and hold the Xbox button on the console for a minimum of 5 seconds to turn off the console.</li>
                    <li>Unplug the power cord from the back of the modem.</li>
                    <li>After one minute, plug the modem back in and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.</li>
                    <li>Turn on the console.</li>
                    <li>Test your Xbox connection again (Profile & system > Settings > General > Network settings > Test network connection).</li>

                    <li>You may need to contact your internet service provider (ISP) to resolve this issue. For example, you may need to ask your ISP to replace a defective modem, verify the settings on your modem, or check your connection speed.</li>
                    <li>In addition, not all ISPs use the same network layout, protocols, and processes. It’s also possible that your ISP may be experiencing known issues that could be blocking your Xbox from connecting.</li>
                    <li>Before you contact your ISP, be sure to document as much of the problem as you can. Write down any error messages that you receive and any changes that you have made while troubleshooting the issue.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Power cycle your console</li>
                    <li>Unplug the power cable from the back of the router, modem, or gateway for 5 minutes. If you have a router and a modem, unplug the power cable from both devices.</li>
                    <li>Restart your console. Press and hold the Xbox button in the center of your controller to open the Power Center. Select Restart console and then select Restart.</li>
                    <li>(If the console appears to be frozen, press and hold the Xbox button on the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off. After the console shuts down, touch the Xbox button on the console again to restart.)</li>
                    <li>After 5 minutes, plug the modem or gateway in first, and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.</li>
                    <li>If you are using a router, plug in the router and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.</li>
                    <li>Test your connection again (Profile & system > Settings > General > Network settings > Test network connection). If the connection test is not successful, continue to the next step.</li>

            <b>Step 10:</b> Wired connections (Check the network cable)
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOTE: Carefully examine every network cable that is plugged into the modem, gateway, or router for kinks, stripped plastic shielding, and exposed or frayed wires. If you see any defects in a network cable, replace it. This could be the source of your issue.</li>
                    <li>Unplug the network cable from the back of your console.</li>
                    <li>Inspect the cable’s connector and the console socket to make sure that they are clean and free of debris.</li>
                    <li>Plug it back in, making sure it clicks into place.</li>
                    <li>Follow the network cable to your router, modem, or gateway and unplug it.</li>
                    <li>Inspect the cable’s connector and the socket of the router, modem, or gateway socket to make sure that they are clean and free of debris. Do one of the following (depending on your network hardware): Router or gateway: Plug the network cable into a different port. Modem: Plug the network cable back into the modem.</li>
                    <li>Verify that all power cables are firmly seated in the modem, gateway, or router and that all networking devices are powered on.</li>
                    <li>Test your connection again (Profile & system > Settings > General > Network settings > Test network connection). If the connection test is not successful, continue to the next step.</li>
